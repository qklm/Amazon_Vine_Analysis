## Summary
There is not a high differential between the 2 sets of reviews, but the Vine reviews take up an incredibly meager faction of total reviews. In this tiny snapshot of the Vine program, it appears to be more or less in line with organic user reviews erring slightly higher. 

In addition to this quick study, it would be advantageous to lock in on high review community members (10 or more reviews in the given time frame) and analyze their helpfulness to consider the next round of Vine reviewers.
